# CalculusApp

## Description
CalculusApp is a .NET MAUI application developed as a learning assignment to explore and apply APIs, LaTeX rendering, and MAUI development. This project demonstrates how to integrate modern libraries and frameworks for mathematical rendering.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET 9
- **IDE:** Visual Studio (recommended)
- **Platform:** Windows (MAUI)
- **Dependencies:**
  - [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/): A JavaScript library for rendering LaTeX expressions into HTML.
  - [Newton API](https://newton.now.sh/): A RESTful API for performing calculus operations programmatically.
  - .NET MAUI built-in libraries for multi-platform support.

## Features

- Interactive calculus solver for derivatives, integrals, and limits.
- Visual rendering of mathematical expressions using LaTeX and MathJax.
- API-powered solutions for calculus problems using the Newton API.
- Cross-platform support for desktop and mobile devices.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/frepo611/CalculusApp.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Restore NuGet packages (if any).
4. Build and run the application.

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
